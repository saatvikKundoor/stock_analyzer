# stock_analyzer
Simulate and visualize different market outcomes for your stock and compare it to the S&P500.

Why use this?
As an investor, it is important to be able to understand the different possibilities of your investments, especially under different circumstances. This tool allows you to input different possibilities, and come out with a visualization. 

How? 
As a user, you input: 
- Amount you're investing
- How long you're holding
- Expected annual returns
    -Bullish (best case scenario)
    -Bearish (worst case scenario)
    -Base (likely scenario)
- Expected Capital Gains tax rate

Then, the model will output: 
- You're expected returns (after tax) 
- What would've happened if you invested in the S&P500 
- A bar graph that visualizes each different outcome.
